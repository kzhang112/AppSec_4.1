Part 4: Oops, was that card yours?
There exists a vulnerability in the REST API that allows users to use GiftCards that do not belong to them. In a file called BUG.txt, explain why this vulnerability may be occurring, and how it can be fixed. Your explanation should be no larger than a paragraph.

You can start looking for this vulnerability in the following files:

UseCard.kt
CardInterface.kt

Think about how the application is telling the server which card to use, and how that may be problematic.
